# semba-fdtd

In a nutshell, semba-fdtd capabilities are

+ Cluster working capabilites through MPI.
+ Multiple threads per processor through OpenMP.
+ Closed/symmetric problems by means of PEC and PMC conditions.
+ Open problems by means of PML boundary conditions (CPML formulation) or by Mur ABCs.
+ Non-uniformly meshed domains by means of rectilinear (or graded) meshes.
+ Bulk lossless and lossy dielectrics.
+ Materials with frequency dependent relative permittivity and/or permeability, with an arbitrary number of complex-conjugate pole-residue pairs.
+ Bulk anisotropic lossless and lossy dielectrics.
+ Equivalent models of multilayered skin-depth materials.
+ Branched multiwires.
+ Multiconductor transmission lines networks embedded within 3D FDTD solvers.
+ Coupling with SPICE solvers (ngspice).
+ Junctions of wires of different radii.

  1. Junctions of multiwires.
  2. Wire bundles.
  3. Loaded with p.u.l resistance and inductance wires.
  4. Grounding through lumped elements.

+ Plane-wave illumination with arbitrary time variation.
+ Multiple planewaves illumination for reverberation chamber modeling.
+ Hertzian dipole sources.
+ Equivalent Huygens surfaces.
+ Low frequency thin composites and lossy surfaces.
+ Thin slots.
+ Time, frequency and transfer function probes.
+ Near-to-far field transformation.

# Usage

## Running from prebuilt binary releases

Prebuilt binares are available at [releases](https://github.com/OpenSEMBA/fdtd/releases).

In windows, you need to install [intel oneapi runtime libraries](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/tool/oneapi-standalone-components.html).

## Compilation

It is important to point out the repository has dependencies which are available as submodules. It is necessary to run `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` from the root folder before running any `cmake` or `build` commands.

If you use intel oneapi compiler, make sure to run

```shell
  source /opt/intel/oneapi/compiler/latest/env/vars.sh
  export FC=ifx
  export CC=icx
  export CXX=icpx
```

### Compilation options

#### HDF5 Libraries

HDF5 precompiled libraries for ubuntu are used by default (see [precompiled libraries cmake script](set_precompiled_libraries.cmake)).  

You can compile HDF5 for your specific platform downloading the latest sources from this [link](https://www.hdfgroup.org/downloads/hdf5/source-code/).
Extract to a folder and build and install with the following commands

```shell
  cmake -S . -B build-ifx --fresh -DHDF5_BUILD_FORTRAN=YES
  cmake --build build-ifx -j 
  cmake --install build-ifx --prefix ~/hdf5-installed 
```

A specific HDF5 library can be set with the option `-DHDF5_ROOT=<path-to-library>`, e.g.

```shell
  cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DHDF5_ROOT=~/hdf5-installed -DHDF5_USE_STATIC_LIBRARIES=TRUE --fresh 
  cmake --build build -j
```

#### MTLN and ngspice

MTLN depends on `lapack` and `ngspice`. Precompiled versions are included for windows (intelLLVM) and ubuntu (intelLLVM and GNU).
For other platform/compilers these will need to be compiled.

##### Compiling ngspice

In linux, when using some of the provided scripts you may find problems with carriage returns. These can be fixed with:

```shell
sed -i -e 's/\r$//' compile_linux.sh
sed -i -e 's/\r$//' autogen.sh
find . -name \*.m4|xargs dos2unix\nfind . -name \*.ac|xargs dos2unix\nfind . -name \*.am|xargs dos2unix
```

the `ngspice` static library can be compiled doing the following:

1. Edit `configure.ac`, to `AC_SUBST([STATIC], [-static])`
2. Edit `compile_linux_shared.sh`, to 
```
libngspice_la_CFLAGS = -static

libngspice_la_LDFLAGS = -static -version-info @LIB_VERSION@
```


#### MPI

If you use intel oneapi, make sure to load the mpi environment variables:

```shell
  source /opt/intel/oneapi/mpi/latest/env/vars.sh
```

## Testing

Tests must be run from the root folder. `python` wrapper test assumes that `semba-fdtd` has been compiled successfully and is located in folder `build/bin/`. For intel compilation it also assumes that the intel runtime libraries are accessible.

## Running cases

`semba-fdtd` uses the following [format](doc/smbjson.md) as input files.
These can be run with

```shell
  semba-fdtd -i CASE_NAME.fdtd.json
```
